# Arithmetic Operations Project

This repository contains a simple Python project that performs basic arithmetic operations such as sum, difference, and product. The project is modularized, with each operation implemented in its own module.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main program providing a menu-driven interface for users to select arithmetic operations.
- `difference_calc.py`: Module to calculate the difference between two numbers.
- `product_calc.py`: Module to calculate the product of two numbers.
- (Add other module files as needed, e.g., `sum_calc.py`)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/21f3000697/21f3000697_git_challenge_lab.git
cd 21f3000697_git_challenge_lab.git
2. Run the main program:

python main.py

3. Follow the on-screen menu to perform arithmetic operations.

## Development Workflow

- Main branch contains stable working code.
- Features such as new arithmetic modules are developed in separate branches (e.g., `feature-difference-calc`).
- Feature branches are merged into main via pull requests with descriptive commit messages.

## Contribution

Feel free to fork the repository and add more arithmetic modules or features. Please submit pull requests for review before merging.
